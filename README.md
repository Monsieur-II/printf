OVERVIEW:

This project is a simple implementation of the printf function in C.
It aims to replicate some basic functionalities of the standard printf function found in the C library.
This function will generate output based on a given format string, which may contain conversion specifiers for characters, strings, and the percent symbol.
The output will be written to the standard output stream (stdout).

Valid Format Specifiers:

%c: Prints a single character.
%s specifier: Prints a string, terminated by a null character.
%%: Prints a percent symbol.
%d and %i: Print signed integers.
